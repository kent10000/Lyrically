# Lyrically
What I use to get lyrics for spotify. \
Spotify recently implemented the MusixMatch api to provide lyrics in-app but only certain songs are in the database. \
For every song thats not I made Lyrically to scrape Genius Lyrics and provide lyrics \
Also decided to try dotenet so first time using C# \
\
I know my scraper uses RegEx... I will rewrite it when it breaks \
\
Enjoy the mega scuffed code
